# Contributing

Katon is still in an early stage of development.

If you are interested in formal verification, programming languages, or compiler construction—or if you are working on a programming languages assignment—you are welcome to try Katon and contribute.

## Ways to Contribute

Contributions of all kinds are appreciated, including:

1. Bug reports:
report incorrect behavior, crashes, or unsound verification results.

2. Documentation improvements:
clarify existing documentation, fix inaccuracies, or add missing language reference sections.

3. Language and verifier development:
work on the type system, semantics, verification condition generation, or SMT integration.

4. Design discussions:
propose or discuss language features, semantics, or design trade-offs.

## Contribution Process

1. Use GitHub Issues for bug reports, feature requests, and design discussions.

2. Submit changes via pull requests.

3. Small, focused pull requests are preferred.

For non-trivial changes, opening an issue for discussion first is recommended.
